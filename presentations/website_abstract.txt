Paper published in December 2022: Simulation of deflection uncertainties on directional reconstructions of muons using PROPOSAL

Large-scale neutrino telescopes have the primary objective to detect and characterize neutrino sources 
in the universe. These experiments rely on the detection of charged leptons produced in the 
interaction of neutrinos with nuclei. In general, the energy and the direction of 
an incoming particle are estimated via likelihood methods. With new reconstruction algorithms 
using machine learning and hardware optimizations, the direction of an incoming 
muon can be measured with an angular resolution lower than 1 degree in telescopes like 
the IceCube Neutrino Observatory or KM3NeT. 

However, high-energetic muons are able to travel many kilometers 
through dense media like ice and water. In these media, the muons interact 
very frequently with energy losses of up to 90% of the muon energy 
and even larger energy losses are possible. In each interaction, there is 
a momentum transfer which leads to a small deflection of the initial muon 
direction. The question is: Does these deflections accumulate and result to 
a total deflection on the order of magnitude of the angular resolution of current 
neutrino telescopes?

In this paper, the lepton simulation framework PROPOSAL is used 
to simulate the muon propagation and its deflections. The tool is optimized to perform efficient 
lepton and photon propagations at very high energies and it is developed and maintained in our working group 
in Dortmund. 
As a validation, Data-Monte-Carlo comparisons as well as comparisons with the simulation tools MUSIC 
and Geant4 are performed. Single deflections per interaction and the accumulated defelction 
after a propagation through water and ice are studied. Finally, the impact of muon deflections 
for large scale neutrino telescopes and muography are discussed.
