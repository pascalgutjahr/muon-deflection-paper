Muon deflection studied with PROPOSAL

The observation of incoming muon-neutrinos and muons rely on the reconstruction 
of the detected muons in a detector. In general, the energy and the direction of 
an incoming particle are estimated. In the past, there were many hardware 
improvements performed and even new algorithms were developed to optimize the 
reconstruction. With these improvements, the direction of an incoming 
muon can be measured with an angular resolution lower than 1 degree. 

However, very high-energetic muons are able to travel many kilometers 
through dense media like ice and water. In these media, the muons do 
a lot of interactions with energy losses of up to 99% of the muon energy 
and even larger energy losses are possible. In each interaction, there is 
momentum transfer which leads to a small deflection of the initial muon 
direction. 

In this presentation, the lepton simulation framework PROPOSAL is used 
to estimate the accumulated muon deflection. Muons with different energies 
are propagated through ice and water over several distances. Data-Monte-Carlo 
comparisons as well as comparisons with other simulation tools MUSIC and Geant4 
are shown. Finally, the impact of muon deflections for large scale neutrino 
telescopes is discussed.
