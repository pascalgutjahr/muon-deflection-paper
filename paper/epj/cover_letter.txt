Dear Editor, 

we want to submit a regular article with the title 
"Simulation of Deflection Uncertainties on Directional Reconstructions of Muons 
Using PROPOSAL" to the European Physics Journal C.

We confirm that this work is original and has not been published in any other 
journal. 


In this manuscript, the lepton propagator PROPOSAL is used to simulate 
deflections of muons to estimate whether or not these deflections have to 
be taken into account as a systematic uncertainty on the angular 
resolution of very large neutrino telescopes. To study this in more detail, 
deflections on stochastic interactions are implemented in PROPOSAL recently. 
The paper shows consistency with two other common simulation tools MUSIC 
and Geant4 and two data-MC comparisons are performed with good agreement.
Finally, an overview with angular resolutions 
of different detectors is presented with the simulated 
muon deflections in dependency of the energy. 
On the one hand, it shows which experiments are already affected today, on the 
other hand, it becomes clear how much the angular resolution can be improved in the 
future without being affected by the muon deflections.
Additionally, it has been found that the muon deflection primarily depend 
on the final muon energy after the propagation - the initial muon energy is 
negligible. The median muon deflection is fit by a polynomial and can be used to 
estimate the deflection in dependency of the muon energy before the detector entry.
