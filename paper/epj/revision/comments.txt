Author's comments

Referee 1:
1. 
    - Muon tomography: mentioned only twice: remove it from the abstract 
        or add 
        discussion section for muon tomography. --> changed to muography and added 
        small discussion
2.
    - TODO: Figure 5 is not clear. What is not clear? --> add table with all 
        data points
    - Figure 5: add propagated distances (average)
    - mention, that muons with a fixed final energy propagate various 
        distances
3.
    - TODO: Figure 5 represents no realistic scenario. --> realistisches Szenario aus 
        Astro-Neutrino Sicht, da nur Eingangsenergie bekannt
    - TODO: Each detector is located in a different medium with a different 
        thickness of matter -> zenith dependent -> add plot with muon deflections 
        as a function of the final muon energy and thickness of matter (water)
    - TODO: instead of fixed energies, use cosmic-ray spectrum or spectrum of 
        an astrophysical neutrino source
    - Do the same simulations with Geant4 and compare the total results: The Goal
        of this paper is to estimate the muon deflections with the tool PROPOSAL 
        at energies larger than GeV. Furthermore, Geant4 is not optimized to do 
        simulations over large distances of kilometers. Hence, it is not 
        possible to do the exact same simulations with Geant4 in a certain 
        amount of time.
4.
    - remove intensive computing
5.
    - 4.1: added short description of the simulation
6.
    - Figure 1, caption and text: explain an interaction in the multiple scattering 
        process 
7.
    - split in two sentences
8.
    - Figure 3: proposal underestimates for 0 < theta < 2 and for 3 < theta < 6
9.
    - Figure 4: mention, that there were 2 PROPOSAL simulations. The tails
        of all distributions seem to be correlated, since the binning of the 
        data points is shifted to wider bins
    - TODO: Figure 3 and 4: at 0.5 degree, data and simulated curves are all 
        changing their shape - why? --> have a look at the Molière 
        parametrization --> too simple to describe the data perfectly?

Referee 2:
Introduction:
    - added link and standard reference
    - use \textsc{Geant4}
2. Overview of the Simulation Tool PROPOSAL 
    - which energy cuts are chosen and why?! --> Typically we use 0.05 and 
        500 MeV --> used in Koehne and Soedingrekso PhD
    - Ref. 16 (Soedingrekso) for muon decay -> semi-trivial -> removed Ref.
    - TODO: Alameddine et al, this way is unusual --> what is the correct way?
3. Muon Deflection per Interaction 
    - use deg for 10^{} and ° for single numbers
    - I don't use [unit] because of the style guide in: https://www.bipm.org/documents/20126/41483022/SI-Brochure-9-EN.pdf, Section 5.4
    - Multiple Scattering (MS) - Multiple Scattering Molière (MSM) - 
        Multiple Scattering Highland (MSH)
4.1 Comparison with MUSIC and Geant4 
    - moved [21] to introduction and removed references at the beginning of this    
        subsection
    - Detailed information in Table 2: 
        1) There are no standard deviations given in Ref. [21]
        2) TODO: The mean values of the angles and the deflections are very similar, 
            which leads to the result, that all three simulations tools 
            have a similar output referred to the deflection angle 
            and the lateral displacement. Thus the results of PROPOSAL are 
            consistent with the results of MUSIC and Geant4. In general, I mean 
            the results of PROPOSAL are consistent with the mean values and 
            the distributions.
            ???Is this fine as an explanation???
4.2 Data-MC Agreements and 4.3 Muon Deflection Impact on Angular Resolutions
    - added Data-MC ratio plots
    - added Geant4 comparison for Akimenko et al
    - added statement in discussion of Figure 5, that the presented data-MC 
        agreements are very different to the used energy of the user's case
    - Figure 5: explain, why energy range from 1 GeV to 10 PeV is chosen 
    - parameter b seems to be compatible with 0 -> there was a mistake! 
        Additionally, the fit in the figure used a higher precision on the 
        parameters. Now I mentioned 4 digits of the parameters and I changed 
        the fit in plot, since the fit is slightly shifted with 3 digits per 
        parameter. Now it is plot with exactly these parameters and not 
        with the parameters of the higher precision. 
    - Eq. (2) and (3): Mention explicitly, in which energy range this 
        equation is valid: 1 GeV to 50 PeV
