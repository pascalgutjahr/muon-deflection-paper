Referee 2:
Introduction:
    - added link and standard reference
    - use \textsc{Geant4}
2. Overview of the Simulation Tool PROPOSAL 
    - TODO: which energy cuts are chosen and why?!
    - Ref. 16 (Soedingrekso) for muon decay -> semi-trivial -> removed Ref.
    - TODO: Alameddine et al, this way is unusual
3. Muon Deflection per Interaction 
    - TODO: use deg instead of °
    - I don't use [unit] because of the style guide in: https://www.bipm.org/documents/20126/41483022/SI-Brochure-9-EN.pdf, Section 5.4
    - Multiple Scattering (MS) - Multiple Scattering Molière (MSM) - 
        Multiple Scattering Highland (MSH)
4.1 Comparison with MUSIC and Geant4 
    - moved [21] to introduction and removed references at the beginning of this    
        subsection
    - Detailed information in Table 2: 
        1) There are no standard deviations given in Ref. [21]
        2) TODO: The mean values of the angles and the deflections are very similar, 
            which leads to the result, that all three simulations tools 
            have a similar output referred to the deflection angle 
            and the lateral displacement. Thus the results of PROPOSAL are 
            consistent with the results of MUSIC and Geant4. In general, I mean 
            the results of PROPOSAL are consistent with the mean values and 
            the distributions.
            ???Is this fine as an explanation???
4.2 Data-MC Agreements and 4.3 Muon Deflection Impact on Angular Resolutions
    - TODO: add Data-MC ratio plots
    - TODO: add Geant4 comparison for Akimenko et al?
    - TODO: add statement in discussion of Figure 5, that the presented data-MC 
        agreements are very different to the used energy of the user's case
    - TODO: Figure 5: explain, why energy range from 1 GeV to 10 PeV is chosen 
    - TODO: parameter b seems to be compatible with 0 -> exclude or discuss this 
    - TODO: Eq. (2) and (3). Mention explicitly, in which energy range this 
        equation is valid
