line : comment
- 127 and 322: only half space between ~ and 1°
- 176: no *SI* before 0.27
- 192: MeV/c instead of MeV/C 

Table 2: PROPOSAL, MSM, MSH and the corresponding values 77.9 and 331±178 are not centered! 
	In this way, the table is totally unclear! Please have a look at my original table attached to the submitted article and center the values. 

Table 3: The energies in the first line are not centered -> please center these
