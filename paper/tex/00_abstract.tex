For uncertainty estimation of reconstruction of the muon direction, the 
deflection of muons along a propagated path in ice and water is simulated using 
the tool PROPOSAL (Propagator with optimal precision and optimized speed for all leptons), which considers multiple scattering and stochastic deflection. 
The deflection per interaction spans several 
orders of magnitude with $\theta \in [\SI[print-unity-mantissa = false]{e-9}{\degree},\, \SI{1}{\degree}]$ 
for energies $E < \SI{1}{\peta\electronvolt}$ 
and is rather negligible. The accumulated 
deflection of a muon with an energy $E_{\mathrm{\mu}} = \SI{500}{\giga\electronvolt}$ 
after a propagated track is about $\theta_{\text{acc}} = 0.10_{-0.02}^{+0.27}\,\si{\degree}$ 
with a $\SI{95}{\percent}$ central interval, which is in the order of magnitude of 
the directional resolution of 
present neutrino detectors. This deflection can be simply parametrized in 
dependence of the final muon energy. Furthermore, the deflections are compared to the results 
of the propagation tools MUSIC and GEANT4 and all deflections are in good 
agreement.
