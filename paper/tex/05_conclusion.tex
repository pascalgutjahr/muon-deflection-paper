\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}
\begin{itemize}
    \item deflection per interaction is negligible
    \item accumulated deflection is in the order of magnitude of KM3NeT for low energy muons (GeV-TeV) 
    \item median accumulated defl can be fit and used for simple deflection estimation, since deflection mainly depends on final particle energy
    \item relevance of muon-neutrino angle vs. muon deflection for higher energies
\end{itemize}
