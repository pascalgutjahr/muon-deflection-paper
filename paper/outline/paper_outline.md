## Title
- Simulation of Muon Deflection with PROPOSAL and NN-Based Deflection Parametrization 

## Abstract

## Chapters 
- Motivation
- Deflection per interaction along the track
    - How to show these deflections? --> diff or angle?
- Accumulated/total muon deflection
    - Which E_i and E_f?
    - Combined plot for different E_f --> fit possible?
- NN-Based deflection parametrization (look-up table)
    - usecase: quick deflection estimation

## Plots
- Deflection per interaction (which E_i, E_f?)
- Accumulated/total muon deflection --> combined plot 
- NN result --> examples?


## General 
- Naming of the parametrizations: use Van Ginneken or cross-sections?
- How many events per plot?
- Use mode and smallest interval (depends on binning)  or median and central interval?

## Important things not to show! -> next technical PROPOSAL paper 
- Implementation of deflection
- Sampled deflections --> Soedingrekso Diss. Fig. 4.20
- Comparison of different deflection parametrizations
- Comparison to MUSIC
- Limits of small deflections
- Comparison of deflections for different e_cut and v_cut settings
- Comparison of different scattering methods (moliere, highland, highlandintegral) --> Soedingrekso Diss. Fig. 5.6
