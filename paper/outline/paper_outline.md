## Title
- Simulation of Muon Deflection with PROPOSAL and NN-Based Deflection Parametrization 

## Abstract

## Chapters 
- Motivation
- Deflection per interaction along the track
- Accumulated muon deflection
- NN-Based deflection parametrization (look-up table)

## Plots

## General 
- Naming of the parametrizations: use Van Ginneken or cross-sections?

## Important things not to show! -> next technical PROPOSAL paper 
- Implementation of deflection
- Comparison to MUSIC
- Limits of small deflections
- Comparison of deflections for different e_cut and v_cut settings
